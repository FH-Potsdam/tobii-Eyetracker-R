Tobii Eyetracker in R
=====================

Just a small test to plot the data exported by the tobii eyetracker in R

- Go to [r-project.org/](http://www.r-project.org/)  
- download and install R for your OS from one of the servers  

##Mac OSX  

Open a Terminal window and enter the follwing code (This creates an R envoirment file in your home directory)  

    echo "R_LIBS=/Users/$HOME/rLibrary" > $HOME/.Renviron

Then enter (This creates a folder called rLibrary in your homefolder. All installed libraries will go there.)  

    mkdir ~/rLibrary  

###Start R.app from your Applications folder  

####Check your current working directory by entering:  

    getwd()  

The result should point to your home folder.  

####Set your working directory to somewhere where you can remember.
e.g the Desktop or whereever you cloned this repo.  

    setwd("/Users/[YOUR USER NAME]/Desktop/tobii-Eyetracker-R")  

Now you can place files in there and read them with R.  

Open the eyetracker.R with the R.app.  
Select the lines you want to execute  
hit cmd + enter
